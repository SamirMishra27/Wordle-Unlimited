### Inspiration

If you recognize the popular Wordle game from 2022, which went viral during pandemic times, **[became the most searched word in 2022](https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/wordle-is-the-most-searched-term-on-google-in-2022-tops-ukraine-and-queen-elizabeth-101670498879949.html)** and got later acquired by NYTimes, this is inspired by that. 

My aim was to build a *better* version of Wordle, with enhanced features and unlimited play chances.

I decided to build another wordle for learning purposes and give myself a challenge to make this puzzle with React. It definitely felt like an impossible task at the first day but eventually I figured everything out and made it. I also took no help from the internet because, like I said I wanted to challenge myself and figure everything out on my own.

### Future updates

The main project is finished! But I will keep continuing to improve it and add more features to it to make the game even better and give it that special advantage over other puzzle games.
